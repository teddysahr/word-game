## About
"33" is a new word game/puzzle that challenges players to "morph" words into other words - for fans of crosswords, NYT spelling bee, wordle, etc.

## Description

This project was made with html, css, and vanilla javascript. Users are first presented with some simple instructions and a start button. Presssing the start button will start the clock and tack them to the game. When they've completed the puzzle, they will get their final stats to compare with friends. They will also have the option at this point to play another round. At any point the user can click the "?" at the top-left corner for a more detailed "how to play." The "@" at the top-right corner opens a window that has my contact info.
